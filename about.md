## Achievements


* [**Framework implementation**](#)

   Framework building and designing would be a highlight in my work experience.
   I have successfully build frameworks which are flexible and scalable.

***

* [**Consumer Products**](#)

    Since October, 2015 I have been working in product companies which were
    consumer facing one way or other. Some were into a niche market, some in hyper
    delivery and some in loyalty.
    My experiences here have helped me and the companies deliver a seem less
    experience to the consumer which directly helped the company in building a
    better product.

***

* [**Performance Testing**](#)

    Zinrelo was scaling and faced issues with load and Performance. At Zinrelo we
    build a Gatling Framework which helped us in identifying and cleaning the
    bottleneck which ruined the user experience.
