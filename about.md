I possess extensive experience of 11+ years in the design and implementation of automation frameworks, having successfully contributed to a wide range of projects, particularly within startup environments. My work has been instrumental in solving complex issues related to delivery, loyalty programs, enterprise solutions. My approach to these challenges has consistently involved building robust teams capable of delivering high-quality products. I have also taken a proactive role in defining and establishing effective quality assurance (QA) practices and workflows, as well as recommending QA policies that not only enhance product quality but also drive meaningful improvements to the overall user experience.

## Achievements


* [**Framework implementation**](#)

   Framework building and designing would be a highlight in my work experience.
   I have successfully build frameworks which are flexible and scalable.

***

* [**Consumer Products**](#)

    Since October, 2015 I have been working in product companies which were
    consumer facing one way or other. Some were into a niche market, some in hyper
    delivery and some in loyalty.
    My experiences here have helped me and the companies deliver a seem less
    experience to the consumer which directly helped the company in building a
    better product.

* [**Performance Testing**](#)

    Zinrelo was scaling and faced issues with load and Performance. At Zinrelo we
    build a Gatling Framework which helped us in identifying and cleaning the
    bottleneck which ruined the user experience.
